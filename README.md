# Nervos Network RFCs

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20Discord-7289DA.svg)](https://discord.com/invite/nervos)

This repository contains proposals, standards and documentations related to Nervos Network.

The RFC (Request for Comments) process is intended to provide an open and community driven path for new protocols, improvements and best practices, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction of Nervos network is evolving in.

RFCs publication here does not make it formally accepted standard until its status becomes Standard.

## Categories

Not all RFCs are standards, there are 2 categories:

* Standards Track - RFC that is intended to be standard followed by protocols, clients and applications in Nervos network.
* Informational - Anything related to Nervos network.

## Process

The RFC process attempts to be as simple as possible at beginning and evolves with the network.

### 1. Discuss Your Idea with Community

Before submitting a RFC pull request, you should send the draft to community to solicit initial feedbacks. The [#rfc-chat discord channel](https://discord.gg/SWE7AtDKc4) or [Nervos Talk](https://talk.nervos.org/) are both good places to go.

### 2. Create A Pull Request

After discussion, please create a pull request to propose your RFC:

> Copy `0000-template` as `rfcs/0000-feature-name`, where `feature-name` is the descriptive name of the RFC. Don't assign a number yet. Reserve a RFC number in [this issue](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/issues/246).

Nervos RFCs should be written in English, but translated versions can be provided to help understanding. English version is the canonical version, check english version when there's ambiguity.

Nervos RFCs should follow the keyword conventions defined in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119), [RFC 6919](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6919).

A RFC should be put in either `Informational Track` or `Standards Track`. A RFC on `Standards Track` is a technical specification for software developers to facilitate an interoperable ecosystem. A RFC on `Informational Track` is a descriptive document providing necessary and/or helpful information to users and builders.

A RFC on `Informational Track` has 3 statuses:

1. `Draft` (initial status)
2. `Withdrawn`
3. `Final`

A RFC on `Standards Track` has 5 statuses:

1. `Proposal` (initial status)
2. `Active`
3. `Withdrawn`
4. `Rejected`
5. `Obsolete`

### 3. Review / Accept

The maintainers of RFCs and the community will review the PR, and you should update the RFC according to feedbacks. When a RFC is ready and get enough supports, it will be accepted and merged into this repository. The acceptance of a RFC is based on [rough consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus) at this early stage, we'll keep improving it as the network and ecosystem develops, until we reached the decentralized governance stage.
