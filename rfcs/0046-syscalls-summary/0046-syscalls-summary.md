# CKB VM Syscalls Summary

This RFC aims to provide a comprehensive summary of all CKB VM syscalls as specified in RFC documents [RFC9 VM Syscalls](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0009-vm-syscalls/0009-vm-syscalls.md), [RFC34 VM Syscalls 2](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0034-vm-syscalls-2/0034-vm-syscalls-2.md), and RFC50 VM Syscalls 3 (currently under review). The goal is to gather relevant information from these documents and present it in an organized table for easy reference and comparison. This RFC also includes relevant constants, such as return codes, sources, cell fields, header fields, and input fields.
