# CKB Consensus Change (Edition CKB2021)

CKB2019, the CKB consensus rules edition, will be upgraded to CKB2021 by the first hard fork. With a hard fork, the embedded rules of the network can be updated and upgraded. These changes are not backward compatible and will be outlined in the document.

## What's New in CKB2021

CKB2021 includes both new features and bug fixes. All changes are proposed via RFCs. The appendix has a list of all the RFCs related to CKB2021.

This upgrade has three main categories. 

- **CKB VM V1**: A major upgrade has been implemented for CKB VM. CKB2021 will bundle CKB VM v1, as well as CKB VM v0, which was bundled in CKB2019. By default, scripts are executed on CKB VM v1. Scripts can be executed on v0 if you set the script hash type to `data`.  
- **Extension Field**: CKB2021 adds a new `extension` field to the block data structure. The field is reserved for future upgrades, such as flyclient.
- **Consensus Patches**: There are a bunch of consensus patches to fix bugs and make the consensus rules more robust.

### CKB VM V1

Since CKB2021, multiple VM versions will be available. ï»¿[RFC32] introduces a CKB VM version mechanism. It piggybacks on the `hash_type` field in the Script structure.

| `hash_type` | JSON representation | matches by | VM version |
| ----------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| 0           | "data"     | data hash        | 0          |
| 1           | "type"     | type script hash | 1          |
| 2           | "data1"    | data hash        | 1          |

In [RFC33], what is new in CKB VM v1 is introduced, and in [RFC34], new syscalls for CKB VM v1 are introduced.

CKB VM v1 includes new features and improves performance. Bugs identified in v0 have been fixed in v1.

A major motivation for the changes in CKB VM is to reduce overheads. CKB VM v1 supports [RISC-V B extension](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-bitmanip) and [macro-op fusion](https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/macro-operation_fusion). With the RISC-V B extension, developers can map RISC-V instructions directly with native instructions provided by x86-64 CPUs, while the macro-op fusion exploits modern microarchitectures in CPUs even further. All those efforts make crypto algorithms more efficient on CKB VM, unlocking more potential use cases of Nervos CKB. For example, the BLS signature verification lock consumes too many cycles on CKB now. Using RISC-V B extension and macro-op fusion, the cycles can be reduced to an acceptable level.

Given the same transaction, different VM versions may consume different cycles, even give different verification results. [RFC35] proposes to use separate transaction relay protocols for each VM version to help the smooth transition of the CKB2021 activation.

### Extension Field

Many extensions require adding new fields to the block structure. For example, PoA for testnet requires 65 bytes for each signature, and flyclient requires a 64 bytes hash. However, there are not enough reserved bits in the header for these extensions. [RFC31] proposes a solution to add a variable length field to the block structure. 

There is no overhead for nodes synchronizing with this field added to the block body. 

CKB2021 will not parse and verify the field after the activation. Instead, it enables a future soft fork to give the definition of the `extension` field. For example, flyclient can store the hash in the `extension` field.

### Consensus Patches

[RFC28] uses block timestamp as the start time for the relative timestamp `since` field, instead of the median of previous 37 blocks. This simplifies the maturity calculation for the `since` filed.

[RFC29] allows multiple matches on dep cells via type script hash when these cells have the same data. It removes unnecessary restrictions when there is no ambiguity about choosing matched script code.

[RFC30] ensures that the index is less than the length in the `since` field using epoch as the time measure. It avoids the ambiguity because of the inconsistent behavior when using relative and absolute epoch `since`.

[RFC36] removes the header deps immature rule, allowing developers to choose how long to wait until a header can be used as a dep header.

## CKB2021 Timeline

The mainnet upgrade is divided into three phases.

* **Stage 1 - Code Preview**: An RC version of 0.100.0 was ready for preview on July 16 2021 via nervosnetwork/ckb [releases](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/releases). It introduces the incompatible changes to help developers adapt their tools and apps to CKB2021. But this version does not activate the consensus incompatible changes in CKB2021. Developers can test the new rules by running a dev chain locally.

* **Stage 2 - Testnet Activation**: With the release of CKB 0.101.0, CKB2021 was set to activate on Aggron testnet on October 24th, 2021. Pudge is the successor guardian of the testnet after the activation. Thank you Aggron, Ogre Magi! Look who's coming for dinner, Pudge!

* **Stage 3 - Mainnet Activation**: With the release of CKB 0.103.0, CKB2021 will be set to activate on Lina mainnet. The exact mainnet activation time will be determined after Stage 2 passed successfully. Mirana will be the successor guardian of CKB mainnet after the activation. Thank you Lina, our flame burns brighter. The moon lights our way, Mirana!

## Upgrade Strategies

First, the SDK, Tool, and dApps authors must adapt to any 0.100.0 rc version.

There are two strategies for ecosystem developers to upgrade to the CKB2021 consensus. Choose the former one if the developers can pause the app during the fork activation, otherwise, choose the latter one.

- Release two different versions or use the feature switcher. Manually deploy the newer version or enable the CKB2021 feature after the fork activation.
- Use the feature switcher and enable the CKB2021 feature automatically when the chain grows into the activation epoch. The activation epoch is different between the testnet and mainnet, which is available via the updated `get_consensus` RPC.
