# Ensure That Index Is Less Than Length In the Input Since Field Using Epoch With Fraction

## Abstract

This document proposes adding a new consensus rule to verify the `since` field in the transaction.

As described in RFC17, [Transaction valid since](../0017-tx-valid-since/0017-tx-valid-since.md), when a transaction input uses the epoch with fraction in the `since` field, the `value` is an encoded rational number `E + I / L`, where

- `E` is the epoch number.
- `I` is the block index in the epoch.
- `L` is the epoch length.

This RFC requires that when any transaction uses the epoch with fraction as the unit, the encoded number `E + I / L` is valid only if

- `I` is less than `L`, or
- `I` and `L` are both zero.

If any `since` field is invalid, the transaction is rejected.

## Motivation

The `since` field prevents the transaction from being mined before an absolute or relative time.

When the `since` field uses the epoch with a fraction number as the unit, the `value` is an encoded rational number `E + I / L`. If it is a relative time, the rational number is used as it is. But when it is an absolute time, the special rule, **Absolute Epoch With Fraction Value Normalization** as mentioned in RFC17, requires normalizing the number to `E + 1 + 0 / 1` when `I` equals to or is larger than `L`.
This document suggests adding a new rule to ensure that, when `since` uses epoch as the unit, the index `I` must be less than the length `L`.

## Specification

This RFC adds a new verification requirement to the transaction `since` field.

When an input `since` field is present, and the `metric_flag` is epoch (01), the `value` part is the encoded number `E + I / L`. No matter whether the relative flag is `relative` or `absolute`, the number is valid only if

- `I` is less than `L`, or
- `I` and `L` are both zero.

In RFC17, the only rule change is the elimination of **Absolute Epoch With Fraction Value Normalization**.

## Test Vectors

When `since` uses the absolute epoch `99 + 360 / 180`, and the current epoch is `100 + 0 / 180`, the transaction is mature under the old consensus rule but is invalid under the new rule.

## Deployment

The deployment can advance in two stages.

In the first stage, the new consensus rule will be activated from a specific epoch. The mainnet and testnet will use different epochs, whereas all other chains will use the new rule from epoch 0.

The second stage is optional. After the new rule is activated, and the blocks in the chain before activation can also pass the new consensus rule, the old rule is redundant and can be safely removed.

## Backward Compatibility

The new rule is stricter than the old one, so it can be deployed via a soft fork. Once most mining nodes have been upgraded to the new version, old full nodes can keep up with it. Old version mining nodes may reject blocks generated by new version full nodes.
