# Deposit and Withdraw in Nervos DAO

## Abstract

This document describes the details of Nervos DAO deposit and withdraw transaction.

## Motivation

Holders can deposit their CKBytes into Nervos DAO at any time. Nervos DAO deposit is a time deposit with a minimum deposit period (counted in blocks). Holders can only withdraw after a whole deposit period. If the holder does not withdraw at the end of the deposit period, those CKBytes should enter a new deposit period automatically, so holders' interaction with CKB could be minimized. This document provides necessary details for users or applications interacting with Nervos DAO.

Nervos DAO is a smart contract with which users can interact the same way as any smart contract on CKB. One function of Nervos DAO is to provide a dilution counter-measure for CKByte holders. By deposit in Nervos DAO, holders get proportional secondary rewards, which guarantee their holdings are only affected by hardcapped primary issuance as in Bitcoin.


## Background

CKB's token issuance curve consists of two components:

- Primary issuance: Hardcapped issuance for miners, using the same issuance curve as Bitcoin, half at every 4 years.
- Secondary issuance: Constant issuance, the same amount of CKBytes will be issued at every epoch, which means the secondary issuance rate approaches zero gradually over time. [Because epoch length is dynamically adjusted](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0020-ckb-consensus-protocol/0020-ckb-consensus-protocol.md), secondary issuance at every block is a variable, flucutates in a range.

If there's only primary issuance, but no secondary issuance in CKB, the total supply of CKBytes would have a hardcap, and the issuance curve would be the exact same as Bitcoin. To counter the dilution effect caused by secondary issuance, CKBytes locked in Nervos DAO will get the proportion of secondary issuance tantamount to the locked CKByte's percentage in circulation.

For more information on Nervos DAO and CKB's economic model, please refer to [Nervos RFC #0015](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics/0015-ckb-cryptoeconomics.md).

## Deposit

Users can send a transaction to deposit CKBytes into Nervos DAO at any time. CKB includes a particular Nervos DAO type script in the genesis block. To deposit to Nervos DAO, one needs to create any transaction containing a new output cell with the following requirements:

- MUST use the Nervos DAO script as type script.
- MUST have 8 bytes length cell data, filled with all zeros.

For convenience, a cell satisfying the above conditions will be called a `deposit cell`. To pass CKB's script validation, one also needs to include a reference to Nervos DAO type script in the `cell_deps` part of the enclosing transaction. Notice there is no limit on the number of deposits completed in one transaction. A single transaction can includes more than one deposit cells.

## Withdraw

Users can send a transaction to withdraw deposited CKBytes from Nervos DAO at any time(but a locking period will be applied to determine when precisely the tokens can be withdrawn). Nervos DAO issues compensation to deposited cells in the withdrawal phase. For a transaction including Nervos DAO withdrawal, the sum of all output cells' capacity might exceed the sum of all input cells' capacity. Unlike the deposit, withdrawal is a 2-phase process:

- In phase 1, the first transaction transforms a `deposit cell` into a `withdrawing cell`.
- In phase 2, a second transaction unlocks and transfers CKBytes in `withdrawing cell` to the recipient.

### Withdraw Phase 1

Phase 1 transforms a `deposit cell` into `withdrawing cell` so the deposit duration of the cell can be determined. Once the `withdrawing cell` is included in CKB, the deposit duration can be calculated by taking the difference of `deposit cell` and `withdrawing cell`'s inclusion block number. With deposit duration, both deposit compensation and the remaining locking period of `deposit cell` can be calculated.

A phase 1 transaction MUST satisfy the following conditions:

- One or more `deposit cell`s MUST be included in the transaction as inputs.
- For each `deposit cell`, the transaction MUST also include reference to its associated including block in `header_deps`, which will be used by Nervos DAO type script as the starting point of deposit.
- For a `deposit cell` at input index `i`, a `withdrawing cell` MUST be created at output index `i` with the following requirements:
    - The `withdrawing cell` MUST use the same Nervos DAO type script as the `deposit cell`.
    - The `withdrawing cell` MUST have the same capacity as the `deposit cell`.
    - The `withdrawing cell` MUST also have 8 bytes length cell data, but instead of 8 zero, it MUST store the block number of the `deposit cell`'s including block. The number MUST be packed in 64-bit unsigned little-endian integer format.
- The Nervos DAO type script MUST be included in the `cell_deps`.

Once this transaction is included in CKB, the user can start preparing the phase 2 transaction.

### Withdraw Phase 2

Phase 2 transaction unlocks deposited tokens together with compensation from Nervos DAO and sends them to the withdrawal recipient. Unlike phase 1 transaction, which can be sent at any time the user wishes, the phase 2 transaction has a since field set to fulfill the locking period requirement. Therefore, one may only be able to create a phase 2 transaction first but must wait for some time before getting the phase 2 transaction included in CKB.

A phase 2 transaction MUST satisfy the following conditions:

- One or more `withdrawing cell`s MUST be included in the transaction as inputs.
- For each `withdrawing cell`, the transaction MUST also include the reference to its associated including block in `header_deps`, which will be used by Nervos DAO type script as the endpoint of deposit.
- For a `withdrawing cell` at input index `i`, the transaction builder should locate the deposit block header, meaning the the header of the original `deposit cell`'s inclusion block. With the deposit block header:
    - The deposit block header hash MUST be included in `header_deps`.
    - The index of the deposit block header hash in `header_deps` MUST be put in the type-script-part of the corresponding witness at index `i`, using 64-bit unsigned little-endian integer format. The example below explains data placement in transaction witnesses.
- For a `withdrawing cell`, the `since` field in the cell input MUST conform to the Nervos DAO's locking period requirement, which is 180 epochs. For example, if one deposits into Nervos DAO at epoch 5, he/she can only expect to withdraw Nervos DAO at epoch 185, 365, 545, etc.
- The sum of all input cells' capacity plus compensation MUST be larger or equal to the sum of all output cells' capacity.
- The Nervos DAO type script MUST be included in the `cell_deps`.

Notice the locking period is independent of the compensation calculation period. It's possible to deposit at epoch 5, initiate withdrawal and get `withdrawing cell` included at epoch 100, and construct a phase 2 withdrawal transaction with a `since` at epoch 185. Please refer to the [since RFC](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0017-tx-valid-since/0017-tx-valid-since.md) on how to set epoch number in the field. Nervos DAO type script only accepts absolute epoch numbers as since values.

It's possible to include multiple phase 2 withdrawals in one transaction.

One transaction can mix and include many deposit and withdrawal actions. For example, a single transaction can consist of all the following actions:

1. Deposit tokens into Nervos DAO.
2. Transform some `deposit cell`s to `withdrawing cell`s.
3. Withdraw from some other `withdrawing cell`s.

## Calculation

This section explains the calculation of Nervos DAO compensation and relevant fields in the CKB block header.

CKB's block header has a particular field named `dao` containing auxiliary information for Nervos DAO's use. Specifically, the following data are packed in the 32 bytes `dao` field in the following order:

- `C_i` : the total issuance up to and including block `i`.
- `AR_i`: the current `accumulated rate` at block `i`. `AR_j / AR_i` reflects the CKByte amount if one deposit 1 CKB to Nervos DAO at block `i`, and withdraw at block `j`.
- `S_i`: the total unissued secondary issuance up to and including block `i`, including unclaimed Nervos DAO compensation and treasury funds.
- `U_i` : the total `occupied capacities` currently in the blockchain up to and including block `i`. Occupied capacity is the sum of capacities used to store all cells.

Each value is encoded as an unsigned 64-bit little-endian number in the `dao` field. To maintain enough precision, `AR_i` is encoded as the original value multiplied by `10 ** 16`.

For a single block `i`, the following values are known:

- `p_i`: primary issuance for block `i`
- `s_i`: secondary issuance for block `i`
- `U_{in,i}` : occupied capacities for all input cells in block `i`
- `U_{out,i}` : occupied capacities for all output cells in block `i`
- `C_{in,i}` : total capacities for all input cells in block `i`
- `C_{out,i}` : total capacities for all output cells in block `i`
- `I_i` : total compensation of completed Nervos DAO withdrawals in block `i` (not includes withdrawing compensation)

In genesis block, the values are defined as follows:

- `C_0` : `C_{out,0}` - `C_{in,0}` + `p_0` + `s_0`
- `U_0` : `U_{out,0}` - `U_{in,0}`
- `S_0` : `s_0`
- `AR_0` : `10 ^ 16`

Then from the genesis block, the values for each succeeding block can be calculated in an induction way:

- `C_i` : `C_{i-1}` + `p_i` + `s_i`
- `U_i` : `U_{i-1}` + `U_{out,i}` - `U_{in,i}`
- `S_i` : `S_{i-1}` - `I_i` + `s_i` - floor( `s_i` * `U_{i-1}` / `C_{i-1}` )
- `AR_i` : `AR_{i-1}` + floor( `AR_{i-1}` * `s_i` / `C_{i-1}` )

With those values, Nervos DAO compensation can be calculated for any deposited cell. Assuming a Nervos DAO cell is deposited at block `m`, i.e. the `deposit cell` is included at block `m`. One initiates withdrawal and gets phase 1 `withdrawing cell` included at block `n`. The total capacity of the `deposit cell` is `c_t`, the occupied capacity for the `deposit cell` is `c_o`. Then its Nervos DAO compensation is calculated as:

( `c_t` - `c_o` ) * `AR_n` / `AR_m` - ( `c_t` - `c_o` )

Meaning that the maximum withdrawable capacity one can get from this Nervos DAO input cell is:

( `c_t` - `c_o` ) * `AR_n` / `AR_m` + `c_o`

## Example

The following type script represents the [Nervos DAO script on CKB mainnet](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0024-ckb-genesis-script-list/0024-ckb-genesis-script-list.md#nervos-dao):

      "args": "0x",
      "hash_type": "type"
    }

And the following OutPoint refers to a cell containing NervosDAO script:

      "out_point": {
        "tx_hash": "0xe2fb199810d49a4d8beec56718ba2593b665db9d52299a0f9e6e75416d73ff5c",

    }

This transaction is actually committed in the following block:

    {
      "compact_target": "0x1a2158d9",
      "hash": "0x37ef8cf2407044d74a71f927a7e3dcd3be7fc5e7af0925c0b685ae3bedeec3bc",

      "proposals_hash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "uncles_hash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",

    }

As mentioned above, the `dao` field contains 4 values, `AR` is the second field in the list. Extracting the little-endian integer from offset `8` through offset `16`, the current deposit `AR` is `10000435847357921`, which is `1.0000435847357921` considering `AR` is encoded with the original value multiplied by `10 ** 16` .

The following transaction can then be used to initiate the phase 1 of withdrawal, which transforms `deposit cell` to `withdrawing cell`:

      "version": "0x0",
      "cell_deps": [

    }

A couple of things worth mentioning in this transaction:

- The input `deposit cell` is included in the `0x37ef8cf2407044d74a71f927a7e3dcd3be7fc5e7af0925c0b685ae3bedeec3bc` block, hence it is included in `header_deps`.
- The including block number is `4191`, which is `0x5f10000000000000` packed in 64-bit unsigned little-endian integer number.
- Looking at the above 2 transactions, the output cell in this transaction has the same type and capacity as the previous `deposit cell`, while storing different cell data.

A couple of things worth mentioning in this transaction:

- The `header_deps` in this transaction contains 2 headers: `0x37ef8cf2407044d74a71f927a7e3dcd3be7fc5e7af0925c0b685ae3bedeec3bc` contains block header hash in which the original `deposit cell` is included, while `0xba6eaa7e0acd0dc78072c5597ed464812391161f0560c35992ae0c96cd1d6073` is the block in which the `withdrawing cell` is included.
- Since `0x37ef8cf2407044d74a71f927a7e3dcd3be7fc5e7af0925c0b685ae3bedeec3bc` is at index 0 in `header_deps`. The number `0` is packed in 64-bit little-endian unsigned integer, which is `0000000000000000`, and appended to the end of the witness corresponding with the Nervos DAO input cell.
- The Nervos DAO input cell has a `since` field of `0x20068d02880000b6`, which is calculated as follows:
    - The deposit block header has an epoch value of `0x68d0288000002`, which means the `2 + 648 / 1677` epoch
    - The block header in which `withdrawing cell` is included has an epoch value of `0x645017e00002f`, which means the `47 + 382 / 1605` epoch
    - The closest epoch that is past `47 + 382 / 1605` but still satisfies locking period requirement is `182 + 648 / 1677` epoch, which is encoded as `0x68d02880000b6`.
    - Since absolute epoch number is used, necessary flags are needed to make the value of since field `0x20068d02880000b6`. Please refer to [`since` RFC](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0017-tx-valid-since/0017-tx-valid-since.md) for more details.

Using the same calculation as above, the `AR` for the withdrawing block `0xba6eaa7e0acd0dc78072c5597ed464812391161f0560c35992ae0c96cd1d6073` is `1.0008616347796555`.

Now the maximum withdrawable capacity can be calculated:

`total_capacity` = 200000000000
`occupied_capacity` = 10200000000 (8 bytes for capacity, 53 bytes for lock script, 33 bytes for type script and another 8 bytes for cell data are needed cost, the sum of those is 102 bytes, which is exactly 10200000000 shannons)
`counted_capacity` = 200000000000 - 10200000000 = 189800000000
`maximum_withdraw_capacity` = 189800000000 * 10008616347796555 / 10000435847357921 + 10200000000 = 200155259131

200155259131 shannons is hence the maximum withdrawable capacity. The transaction has one output with capacity `0x2e9a2ed603` = 200155256323 shannons, it also pays a transaction fee of 2808 shannons, and 200155259131 = 200155256323 + 2808.

## Gotchas

* Nervos DAO only supports *absolute epoch number* as since value in the withdrawal process. If you are using a lock that supports lock period, such as the system included [multi-sign script](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-system-scripts/blob/master/c/secp256k1_blake160_multisig_all.c), please make sure to ONLY use *absolute epoch number* as lock period. Otherwise, the locked Nervos DAO cell cannot be spent.
* CKB has a maturity constraint on referencing header: a block header can only be referenced in a cell that is committed at least 4 epochs after the referenced block header. This constraint limits Nervos DAO withdrawal in the following ways:
   - Phase 1 withdrawal transaction can only be committed 4 epochs after the fund is originally deposited.
   - Phase 2 withdrawal transaction can only be committed 4 epochs after phase 1 withdrawal transaction is committed.
